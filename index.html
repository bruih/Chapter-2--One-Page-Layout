                 <h1> About This Game </h1> 
            <p id="text">Dark Souls III is a 2016 action role-playing video game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It is the fourth overall entry of the Souls series and the final installment of the Dark Souls trilogy.</p>

             <p id="text">It is an action role-playing game played in a third-person perspective. Players have access to various weapons, armour, magic, and consumables that they can use to fight their enemies. Bonfires serve as checkpoints. The Estus Flask is the consumable used for healing in Dark Souls III. Ashen Estus Flasks restore focus points (FP), which can be used for magic or weapon arts. Hidetaka Miyazaki, the creator of the series, returned to direct the game after handing the development duties of Dark Souls II to others in FromSoftware.</p> 
              <p id="text">Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies within its first two months and over 10 million by 2020. Two downloadable content (DLC) expansions, Ashes of Ariandel and The Ringed City, were also made. A complete version containing the base game and both expansions, Dark Souls III: The Fire Fades, was released in April 2017

  <p id="text"> It's like all those anime with overpowered protagonists<br>Except you're not the protagonist" - slime from STEAM REVIEWS.</p>

   <p id="text"> "When you get parried by a headless skeleton not once but twice, you start to question your life choices.<br>Lucky this game is so visually beautiful that all the skeletons in the game won't stop you from coming back to die again and again " - Lady S. from STEAM REVIEWS</p> 
    <p id="text"> "This game is one of my favourite rpg, atleast top 5. The devs really combined all their experiences of the previous games and made something that even people who are knew to the series can master. Also after playing the souls series I can't scratch the boss fight itch, all other games bosses seem under powered and boring. The pvp is also another fun element in this game while I was playing and had nearly no healing item left and a player invaded my game and yet I still overcame it felt so good. Once you go souls series you never go back it is one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming when you finally get through it." - Eesa Kamaldien from GOOGLE REVIEWS.</p>
